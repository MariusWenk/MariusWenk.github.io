After recently graduating from ETH Zürich with a master's degree in **physics**, I am now looking for opportunities where I can apply my knowledge in a job. My interests include **AI alignment** research, software engineering, **bioinformatics** and **alternative proteins**.

I like to learn something new every day and am very fascinated by how **society** works and develops over time. Under the blog section, I would like to share some of the findings and **insights** I have.

On this website, I also present some of my previous **projects** and **repositories**.
